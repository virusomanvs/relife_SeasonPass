# Season Pass Mod Installation Guide (RELIFE)

## 1. Copying PBO

### Client-side
- The `relife_SeasonPass.pbo` file needs to be **moved to your modpack** (your mod's `Addons` folder).

### Server-side only
- The `relife_SeasonPass_Server.pbo` file needs to be **installed on the server only**:
- Place it in the `Addons` folder of the server modpack.
- Make sure this file is **not accessible to clients**!.

## 2. Installing Configuration Files

- The `SEASONPASS` folder and the `relife_SeasonPass.json` file need to be moved to the following path:
/profiles/RELIFE/

Where `profiles` is the path to your DayZ server profiles folder.

## 3. Additional recommendations

- When you first start the mod, it may automatically create additional files inside the `SEASONPASS` folder.

**Note:** After installation, do not forget to restart the server.
